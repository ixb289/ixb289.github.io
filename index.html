      <h2>What's This?</h2>

        <p> A place to show off what I have learned in my Fall 2020 grad school semester.</p>

        <p>As a graduate student at the prestigious <a href="https://welcome.miami.edu/">University of Miami</a>, it is my goal to extract as many skills as possible while I am here. One of these skills is learning the complex and <em>very</em> relevant <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> languages.</p>

        <p>These two methods are the the foundation for everything we know and love about the Internet and in the following pages, I will demonstrate what I have learned.

        <p>Every single company across every single industry has a website and/or some kind of online component. Having this skill under my best is an added bonus wherever I am employed.</p>
