        <p>Isreal is a relatively <em>new</em> country with a rich and contentious history.</p> <p>Declared an official state in 1948, it has been ripe with tensions and conflicts ever since. Israel was officially declared a state after Britain withdrew from its mandate of Palestine. At first, the UN proposed dividing the area into Arab and Jewish states. The Arab nations and armies were quickly defeated when disagreed with the new borders. Since then, Israel has been plagued by wars against its Arab neighbors while simultaneously experiencing rapid population growth. Amidst the turmoil, Israel is also experiencing internal issues resulting from low labor force participation among minority populations, low workforce productivity, combined with a high cost of housing and goods. However, Israel is an up-and-coming powerhouse in the field of cutting-edge, high-tech sectors such as technology and natural gas resources.</p>
